# django-url-and-view

from udemy course Python Django - The Practical Guide
Section 3
Url and view from the app + Redirect responses

Example:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/challenges/november && ./challenges/11
Both of the previus url path gives the user the same http response


Nothing interesting around here, just to practice with Git and GitHub
